## Getting Started
In this project, I have used linters which is a code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. I have followed git and github flow to document my project in a professional way. I have not added any changes directly to the main branch since I know that it will only damage my project.
